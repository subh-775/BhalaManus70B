# 📚 Bhala Manus - No Back Abhiyan  

Bhala Manus is a multimodal AI assistant powered by Groq and Google Generative AI models. This tool enables seamless interaction through text and image inputs, providing insightful responses by leveraging LLM capabilities, vector databases, and web search integrations.

## ⚙ Features  
- **Multimodal Interaction**: Supports both text and image inputs for a diverse range of queries.  
- **Advanced AI Models**: Built on Groq's `llama-3.1-70b-versatile` and `Google Generative AI` for insightful responses.  
- **Contextual Responses**: Leverages chat history, vector databases, and web data for accurate answers.  
- **Vector Database Integration**: Connects to Pinecone for storing and retrieving document embeddings.  
- **Customizable Sidebar Options**: Configure API keys, chat history usage, and web access settings.
